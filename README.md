## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built from the ground up using a modern, frontend-focused tech stack.

* **Core Logic & Animation**: **p5.js** for 2D/3D drawing and animations.
* **Audio Processing**: **p5.sound** library, which acts as a friendly interface for the **Web Audio API** (used for FFT, amplitude analysis, etc.).
* **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive, utility-first design system.
* **GIF Generation**: **gif.js** for client-side GIF encoding.
* **Base**: HTML5, modern JavaScript (ES6+).

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

This project is completely self-contained and requires no build steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file** in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

And you're ready to go!

## üí° How It Works

* **Audio Analysis**: The application uses a **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** object to analyze the audio's frequency spectrum in real-time. This data (bass, mid, treble levels) and the overall amplitude are fed directly into the visualizer drawing functions.
* **Rendering Engine**: p5.js handles all the rendering. A toggle allows the user to switch the p5.js canvas between the default **2D renderer** and the more powerful **WEBGL renderer** for 3D scenes.
* **3D Interaction**: When in WEBGL mode, the `orbitControl()` function from p5.js is enabled, which automatically maps mouse movements to camera transformations (orbit, pan, zoom).
* **State Management**: All user settings and application states (current track, volume, selected theme, etc.) are managed in a central `state` object within the p5.js instance. Settings are persisted to `localStorage`.
